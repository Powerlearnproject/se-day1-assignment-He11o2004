#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design,development,testing and maintenance of software applications.
importance of software engineering in the technology industry is thatit serves as a force of change by propelling digital transformation,fostering nimbleness,unearthing data insights,transforming infrastucture,upholding security,and fueling economic expansion.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering
a)1948:Grace Hopper develops the first compiler,which translates human-readable code into machine code.
b)1957:FORTRAN,the first high-level programming language is released.
c)1960s:The term software engineering is coned.
challenges:Programs were difficult to write and debug.
          :There were few tools and techniques available to help developers.
          :The field lacked a formal body of knowledge.
          
d)1968:The first NATO software Engineering conference is held.
e)1970s:A number of new methodologies are developed including structured programming and object-oriented programming.
f)1980s:The first computer-aided software engineering(CASE)tools are released.
challenges:Dealing with the complexity of software systems.
           :Improving the quality of software.
           :Increasing the productivity of software developers.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phase 1:Planning-it involves defining the softwares purpose and scope,much like pinpointing destination and plotting best route.Key documents such as the project plan and software requiremnent specification are created.This phase fosters effective communication and collaboration within the team.By defining clear roles,responsibilities and expectations,it lays solid foundation for an efficient software development process.
Phase 2:Requirements Analysis-seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users.Done right,it leads to a software solution that meets usesrs needs and exceeds their expectations.
Phase 3:Design-it is all about building the framework.The design phase is the link between the software's purpose and its execution.It is an essential step in creating software that works efficiently and provides an excellent user experience.
Phase 4:Coding-this phase aims to develop software that is functional,efficient and user friendly.It embodies the planning,analyzing,and designing efforts of the preceding stages.
Phase 5:Testing-the Testing phase is instrumental in ensuring the softwares's robustness and reliability.
Phase 6:Deployment:it involvesrolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.The Deployment phase doesn't signal the end but rather a notable milestone.It signifies the shift from a project phase to a product phase,where the software begins to fulfill its purpose.
Phase 7:Maintenance-it is characterised by constant assistance and improvement,which guarantees the software's best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall is more linear methodology that limits a team's ability to diverge from the project plan at different stages in SDLC while Agile gives teams a margin of flexibility at each stage of the SDLC,enabling them to change the course of a project and incorporate new feedback.Waterfall is best for projects with concrete timelines and well defined deliverables while  Agile methodology was created for projects where the significant constraints are not well understood.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer>writing code and developing the entire software product.
                  >sending updates to project manager and working closely with the other team members.
Quality Assurance Engineer>ensuring the quality and reliability of software applications;Their responsibilities include,designing and excuting test case,identifying and reporting bugs,collaborating with developers to resolve issues,performing regression testing and maintaining test documentation.
Project Manager>manage development iterations,coach and sync the development team,ensures efficient communication between the team and the product owner.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs importances>enhanced productivity,improved code quality,consistency and stardards,intergrated tools.
examples of IDEs;Visual studio,Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.
VCS importances>collaboration,history tracking,branching and merging,backup and recovery.
examples of VCS>Git,subversion(SVN) and mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid advancement in technology.
Increasing customer demands in the development stage. 
Inadequate testing and debugging.
Conflicting requirements.
Time limitation.
Scalability.
High avalability.
solutions to these problems.>maintaining accurate records.
                            >attempting to understand from the view point of stake holders.
                            >establishing proper communication with stakeholders.
                            >recognizing conflicting requirements from the stakeholders side.
                            >creating informative and well structured conversations with end consumers.
                            >performing proper market research and competitor's analysis.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-it is the first level of testing;is a type of software testing in which individuals unit or components of the software are tested.Main objective of unit testing is to isolate each component of the software and then perform tests to illustrate that every imdividual component is accurately meeting the requirements and delivering the expected output.
Intergration testing-it is the second level of testing.It is a type of software testing in which individual software components are logically integrated and tested as a group.Main objective is to verify whether individual modules,when combined,work correctly or not as a group.
System testing-is the third level of testing.is software testing in which all components are tested together to ensure that the final prooduct meets specified requirements.Main objective>to make sure that the software product meets specified requirements and runs smoothly as possible in its operating environment.
Acceptance testing.is the last and final level of testing,it determines whether or not the software should be released to the public;It's main objective is to evaluate whether the software complies with the end-user requirements and whether is ready to be deployed.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the processs of iterating a geneative AI prompt to improve its accuracy and effectiveness.it ensures that AI models produce accurate and relevant outputs.it helps AI models grasp context and other nuances minimizing errors and improving the quality od information provided.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:write about impact of social media on society.
Improved prompt:discuss the impact of social media on society and how it has influenced communication and information over the past decades using relevant examples to illustrate points.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear,specific and concise.
